Showcase
========

Showcase organize any directory on a disk into a nice layout of different exhibits with each
sub-directory contributing to the exhibit.   For a sub-directory to be included as an exhibit, 
a showcase.html or a showcase.json file must exist on the sub-directory.

Each entry on showcase is hyperlink in a way such that when clicked, the exhibit itself opens 
up as a page.
